Week 1:

My use of AI has been pretty minimal but I can recall that there were at least 3 exercises for this week in which I did have to rely on AI heavily. It is Question 10, Question 15, and Question 24. The AI I have used is Google Gemini. 
The reason why I needed to use AI for these three questions in particular is because I completely do not remember how to use slice and indexing on strings so I need a full explanation as to how they work again. Otherwise, for the rest of the assignment, I was able to recall these techniques fine or occassionally used Google Gemini for a refresher rather than a crutch. 

I use Google Gemini as it is the most convient and do not have much interest in using other AI models such as ChatGPT or Claude as I do not feel interested in visiting these websites to use them. Besides the advantage that Gemini has is that it is embeded into a search engine which means if I want to look for sources or answers, it will not be hard to get them and I will not need to prompt the AI to give me sources as Gemini provides them by default. 

Otherwise, I've just been using Gemini rather passively and have not relied on it for any other type of assignment as other classes do not allow me to use it. 


Week 2: 
I have used AI a whole lot more often than last week. Some of the Week 2 Excerises required me to completely rely on Google Gemini because of how stumped I was about trying to solve these excerises. I feel somewhat ashamed about it because I pride myself at being a student of integrity. 

Some of the questions that needed me to use AI were questions like 22. As these types of questions asked me a concept in which I completely have forgotten about or is hard to recall from lecture notes. 

Like before, Google Gemini is my go-to because of convience and effectiveness. It is the quickest way for me to get an answer. It is also the easiest way for me to explore or verify why my answer is correct and such. So far, I am not looking for reliability in AI but rather ease of use. This is why I do not use other models such as ChatGPT or any of the sort as I do not need AI to be powerful, I just need one that I can reach easily. 

However, there is one interesting encounter that I would like to share that is not related to this class. I signed up for INST364 and I eventually got kicked out of the course because I did not meet one of the prerequisites and now counts as an "XD" on my transcript. Upon researching what "XD" meant, I found a reddit thread where they jookingly said that it was a Differential and Integration variables and this answer actually got picked up by Microsoft CoPilot when my friend tried to search the answer themselves. To my knowledge, "XD" is an adminastrative drop. 

Week 3: 
I have become more reliant on AI as this week's excerise has become almost impossible for me to figure out on my own. Although I do have plans on attending office hours for assistance in aiding the excerises. I do think that the act of trying to make functions is rather hard. I say that because these functions involve many different complex actions such as looking through lists and tuples, which are concepts that I admittingly do not like. I find myself to be reliant on Google Gemini for this reason. 

Otherwise, I do not have any unique story to tell with Google Gemini as reiterated before, I use Google AI for convience and effectiveness. The fact that AI is integrated within the search engine makes it very easy to use as you will always run into it whenever you use Google. Granted, I have used Google AI to diagnois myself with body lice as I was extremely paranoid that I got infected when I visited South Campus Dining hall this weekend. I cannot say that is my prouder moments in using AI as I now realize that looking to the internet to diagnois illnesses is rather misleading and could lead to dangerous consequences.
