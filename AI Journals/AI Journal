Week 1:

My use of AI has been pretty minimal but I can recall that there were at least 3 exercises for this week in which I did have to rely on AI heavily. It is Question 10, Question 15, and Question 24. The AI I have used is Google Gemini. 
The reason why I needed to use AI for these three questions in particular is because I completely do not remember how to use slice and indexing on strings so I need a full explanation as to how they work again. Otherwise, for the rest of the assignment, I was able to recall these techniques fine or occassionally used Google Gemini for a refresher rather than a crutch. 

I use Google Gemini as it is the most convient and do not have much interest in using other AI models such as ChatGPT or Claude as I do not feel interested in visiting these websites to use them. Besides the advantage that Gemini has is that it is embeded into a search engine which means if I want to look for sources or answers, it will not be hard to get them and I will not need to prompt the AI to give me sources as Gemini provides them by default. 

Otherwise, I've just been using Gemini rather passively and have not relied on it for any other type of assignment as other classes do not allow me to use it.
